# mytalktools
iOS AAC solution

# Introduction
This is the incomplete open-source version of the MyTalkTools iOS client. Communication Disabilities Foundation Inc. is taking over support for the commercial MyTalkTools suite. This change will occur throughout 2023. By the end of 2023 the foundation will offer all of the MyTalkTools Suite (MyTalkTools Mobile for iOS, MyTalkTools for Android, and MyTalkTools Workspace) for no charge.

By the start of 2024 - new bug fixes and feature requests will be handled through open source contributors

# Project
The code, as is, lets you view most boards using your MyTalkTools account (with the exception of hotspot boards). In the current phase, the code is scaffolding out UI elements for editing and library management. Once the UI is scaffolded - functionality will be added.
